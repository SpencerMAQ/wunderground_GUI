# WUnderground scraper GUI

GUI version of a script i made to scrape weather information from the website [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com) for my undergraduate thesis.

[This](http://web.archive.org/web/20130904083910/http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/RPLL/2013/8/29/DailyHistory.html) is a snapshot of the website from 2013 containing sample data used for web scraping.

# Usage

- pip install (or `pip3 install` or `python3 -m pip install`)
- if you simply want to run the program, then `python3 main.py`
- if you want to create a binary for linux systems, then run `pyinstaller main.py`, this will create a directory called `dist`
- navigate to `./dist/main` and execute the `main` file
